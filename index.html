            <p class="modal-desc stay-desc">Note: The average percentage of students remaining in-state for college in the US is exceptionally high and thus states with lower percentages are displayed as closer to black than they are to blue in this representation since the data is
                so skewed toward the higher end of the spectrum for this particular scenario.</p>
